                Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an
                extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history
                and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to
                be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one,
                you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.

                Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European
                settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home
                to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy
                backpack from for your 3-month expedition.

                You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make
                sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the
                best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly
                hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in
                Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep
                your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be
                confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These
                boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

                Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has

                This is where modern power generators were born as well as
                contemporary means of transmitting energy. So we figured this
                would be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light
                for your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads

                Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,”
                although it can be from time to time, is another town worth
                passing through for several different reasons. While it might be
                most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address
                delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also
                has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)

                The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already

                chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most
                likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on
                during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in
                the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an

                From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of
                Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are
                surprisingly common in this particular region of North America,
                over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or
                higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing
                shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's
                largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your
                world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most
                thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach
                it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller coasters
                as you can before continue your bike ride!
